https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-notify.html

    Can create upto 10 triggers for each repository. 
    Triggers are used: 
        1. when someone pushes to repository, send email via SNS topic. 
        2. Notify external build system to start build when pushes to main branch of repository via Lambda. 

    Code Commit -> Repositories -> Repository-Name -> Settings -> Notifications. -> SNS or AWS Bot Chat. 
    Code Commit -> Repositories -> Repository-Name -> Settings -> Trigger to Lambda or SNS 
    
    Although you can configure a trigger to use Amazon SNS to send emails about some repository events, those events are limited to operational events, such as creating branches and pushing code to a branch. Triggers do not use CloudWatch Events rules to evaluate repository events.
